Features:
    Secure Storage: Passwords should be securely stored, perhaps using encryption or hashing to ensure that they cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.

    Password Generation: Include a password generator that can create strong, randomized passwords that are difficult to guess.

    User Authentication: You could require the user to authenticate themselves with a master password before accessing the password manager. This would help prevent unauthorized access to their stored passwords.

    Password Entry and Retrieval: Allow users to add, edit, and delete their stored passwords. They should also be able to easily retrieve their stored passwords when needed.

    User Interface: Develop a simple and easy-to-use terminal-based user interface that allows users to interact with the application and manage their passwords.

    Backup and Restore: Provide an option to backup and restore password data in case of a system failure or other unforeseen circumstances.

    Multi-Platform Compatibility: Ensure that the application is compatible with multiple operating systems, including Ubuntu and other Linux distributions.
